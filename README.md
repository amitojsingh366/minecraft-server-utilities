# Minecarft Server Utilities
This plugin is a modified version of one of my other projects called [Minecraft Discord Chat](https://github.com/amitojsingh366/minecraft-discord-chat)  
I made this for my personal Minecraft Server and it is not intended for public use

## How it works
### Sending messages to discord
Messages are sent to discord using a webhook
### Receiving messages from discord
Messages are received from discord using the [JDA Library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and a [bot account](https://discord.dev)

## How To Run
- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/amitojsingh366/minecraft-server-utilities/releases)
- Put it in your paper server's plugin folder
- Run the server once to generate the config files
- Configure the plugin using the generated config file *(Located at `.plugins/minecraftdiscordchat/config.json`)*
